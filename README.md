CODSOFT Task 3 – ATM Interface
This project is a Java-based console simulation of an ATM system, developed as part of the CodeSoft Internship Program. It allows a user to perform basic banking operations such as checking balance, withdrawing money, and depositing funds through a simple menu-driven interface.

 Features
-  Simulated ATM menu system using Java console
-  Deposit, withdraw, and check balance options
-  Account balance stored and updated using a BankAccount class
-  Input validation for sufficient funds during withdrawal
-  Exit option to gracefully terminate the session

 How It Works
- A user starts with a default account balance (e.g., ₹10,000).
- The ATM menu presents four options:
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Check balance
- Exit
- Transactions are processed accordingly and balance updates are shown.
- The user can repeat actions until they choose to exit.
